# Relative in-play encoding
Using encoding 14 from binary data with baseline "better"
2M stored hands initially (better vs better)
Round: 2M offline from other model in previous round + 2M online
Playing best card during training
Storing samples that are played
Only using normal parameters
Training a 6x100-model on the data generated by the other 2 models as buffer which doesn't play own hands
Also trying to see if the offline-only training is disadvantageous
