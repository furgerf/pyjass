# Relative encoding
Using encoding 12 from binary data
2M stored hands initially (sim-vs-sim)
Round: 2M offline from other model in previous round + 2M online
*Playing best card during training*
Storing samples that are played
Only using normal parameters
Training a 5x100-model on the data generated by the other 2 models as buffer which doesn't play own hands

# Round 1
=> 4M hands
3x100: 53.3/60.6%, loss: 1555.3
4x100: 60.0/65.9%, loss: 1519.7

# Round 1.5
=> 6M hands
5x100: 60.0%, loss: 1516.7 <= has 2M ("duplicate") hands less

# Round 2
*accidentally trained on combined data from previous round*
=> 10M hands
